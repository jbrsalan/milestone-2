# Apartment Rent Price Prediction Project

## Justification
1. Predicting apartment rental prices is crucial for both tenants and property owners to make informed decisions.
2. Real estate agencies and rental platforms can benefit from accurate pricing models to improve market efficiency.
3. The project bridges the gap between rental affordability for consumers and revenue optimization for property owners.

## Problem Background
Apartment rental prices are influenced by multiple factors such as location, size, amenities, and market demand. Accurate price prediction helps tenants find affordable housing and assists property owners in setting competitive rental rates. This project aims to leverage machine learning, particularly XGBoost, to build an accurate predictive model for apartment rent prices.

## Project Output
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts apartment rent prices based on various factors such as:
- *Location*: The area or city where the apartment is located.
- *Size*: The number of rooms and total area of the apartment.
- *Amenities*: Facilities provided, such as parking, gym, or swimming pool.
- *Market Trends*: Seasonal and economic factors affecting rental prices.

## Data
### Dataset Column Descriptions
1. *ID*: Unique identifier for each apartment listing.
2. *Location*: The geographical area where the apartment is situated.
3. *Size*: Number of bedrooms and total square footage.
4. *Amenities*: Features such as parking, air conditioning, gym, etc.
5. *Furnished Status*: Whether the apartment is fully furnished, semi-furnished, or unfurnished.
6. *Rental Price*: The target variable representing the apartment's monthly rent price.

### Usage Example
With these features, users can analyze key factors influencing rental prices and use the model to predict expected rental rates in different locations.

## Method
The project will use XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to develop the prediction model. The model's performance will be evaluated using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)

The model will undergo hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to ensure optimal performance.
